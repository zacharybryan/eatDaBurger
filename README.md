Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
